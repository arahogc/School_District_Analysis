# School_District_Analysis

## Overview and Purpose  

The purpose of this project was to analyze the data for a school district. They primarily wanted to look how students were performing, in particular to how many were passing in reading and math in the different grades. They used these precentages to look at how different sizes and types of schools were performing and if there was a correlation to budget and performance as well. The data was initalized for all these, but then it was discovered that the data provided from ninth graders at Thomas High School (THS) was not reliable, and must be replaced with "NaN". A total of 641 students grades were changed. Below are the results of altering that data to better reflect the performace at Thomas High School. 

## Review of Data 

* How is the district summary affected?  
  * Overall, it did not really change how the overally districty summary was changed, except that the overall passing percentage went down by less than one point, as evidenced in the screenshots below. 

* How is the school summary affected?  
  * None of the other schools were affected by replacing the THS 9th graders' data. 
* How does replacing the ninth graders’ math and reading scores affect Thomas High School’s performance relative to the other schools?  
  * By replacing the ninth graders' math and reading scores we can see that the percentages for math, reading, and overall passing increased, which can be seen below. 
  
  Picture and picture 

* How does replacing the ninth-grade scores affect the following:  
  * Math and reading scores by grade. 
    * This didn't affect any other schools' grades' math and reading scores. But it can be seen that the THS 9th graders' scores are removed.

  * Scores by school spending. 
    * This didn't affect the scores by school spending since only grades were changed, not actually removing the students from the total count, which is how the budget is calculated (total school budget divided by number of students). 
  * Scores by school size. 
    * This did not affect the school size, since all the grades were removed, not the actually removing the students from the list.
  * Scores by school type. 
    * This was not affected, since Thomas High School did not change the type at all during this process. 


## Summary  
Summarize four major changes in the updated school district analysis after reading and math scores for the ninth grade at Thomas High School have been replaced with NaNs.

There were four major changes that after updating the THS ninth graders' scores. The first was that Thomas High School went from a low performing school to be amongest the top five performing schools.

The second, third, and fourth changes were that the % of passing students in math, reading, and overall passing increased, as evidenced as above.
